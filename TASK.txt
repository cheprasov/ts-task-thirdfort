Coding Challenge

Your task is to build a REST API backend application that can be used to manage personal notes in a multi-user environment.

Requirements:
The API must have the following key features:
Save a new note
Update a previously saved note
Delete a saved note
Archive a note
Unarchive a previously archived note
List saved notes that aren't archived
List notes that are archived

You are free to use a technology stack of your choice to build the application. If you aren't familiar with building backend REST APIs, you can find a collection of examples at https://www.todobackend.com (Please note we are not advocating any method used in these examples).

What we are looking for:

Completeness of the API (at a minimum the API should be functionally complete to meet the requirements mentioned above)
Good coding practices (e.g. easy to read and manageable code, adding test cases etc.)
Use of industry best practices

If you think there should be other features not mentioned but required or good to have, you are free to add those features.

The API you create will be used by a UX team as the backend for a Personal Notes application they are building, consider how you would communicate your API details with the UX team.

Once complete, save a README.md file with your code which should include:
How to run your application
Instructions to the UX team (i.e. how to use your API)
Your choice of technology and the reasons for using them (and any alternatives you considered)
If you were to spend more time on this task, what would you change and what other key features would you add.

If you have any questions at all in the meantime, please feel free to reach out ðŸ˜Š

Best of luck!
